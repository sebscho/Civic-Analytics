### The problem
Sidewalks may need repair for a variety of reasons, but one known cause is due to unruly trees and roots that cause buckling. Tree maintenance belongs to the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), but sidewalk repair is largely a chore for the Department of Transportation. The two agencies work together through Sidewalk Repair programs, helping property owners to repair damaged sidewalks and keep trees healthy.

311, the main source for government non-emergency services, provides information, refers residents to where they can find the information they need, and submits service requests. In 2016, there were over 12,000 calls related to “Root/Sewer/Sidewalk Condition” and general “Sidewalk Condition.” When trees damage sidewalks, the DPR submits a foresty work order to make the fix. Can 311 service requests hint at other ways the agencies could work together on sidewalk repair, to anticipage damage sooner or predict where trees may cause sidewalk damage next? What are the data-driven stories we can tell about the relationship between 311 sidewalk complaint data and forestry work orders on the streets overall?

### The data:
* 2016 311 Service Request data
* (DPR) 2016 Forestry Work Order data
