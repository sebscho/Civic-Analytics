# Problem Set 1
### The problem
Sidewalks may need repair for a variety of reasons, but one known cause is due to unruly trees and roots that cause buckling. Tree maintenance belongs to the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), but sidewalk repair is largely a chore for the Department of Transportation. The two agencies work together through Sidewalk Repair programs, helping property owners to repair damaged sidewalks and keep trees healthy.

311, the main source for government non-emergency services, provides information, refers residents to where they can find the information they need, and submits service requests. In 2016, there were over 12,000 calls related to “Root/Sewer/Sidewalk Condition” and general “Sidewalk Condition.” When trees damage sidewalks, the DPR submits a foresty work order to make the fix. Can 311 service requests hint at other ways the agencies could work together on sidewalk repair, to anticipage damage sooner or predict where trees may cause sidewalk damage next? What are the data-driven stories we can tell about the relationship between 311 sidewalk complaint data and forestry work orders on the streets overall?

# Problem Set 2: 

Q: How can we develop a metric for understanding energy performance and peer building comparison that accounts for the differences in building and occupancy characteristics that impact consumption?
- Clean (including outliers) and merge the Local Law 84 data, PLUTO data, and Census data (and other datasets as needed)
- Provide descriptive statistics for the integrated dataset of key variables in your analysis
- Create an appropriate model to test your hypothesis
- Develop a visualization (map) for your results, as well as plots, graphs, and model output
- Discuss your findings in terms of how they address the respective question you set out to answer. Discuss the limitations of your approach and justify any assumptions used in your analysis.
